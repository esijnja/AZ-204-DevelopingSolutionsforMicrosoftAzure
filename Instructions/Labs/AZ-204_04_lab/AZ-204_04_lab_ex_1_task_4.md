#### Task 4: Create an Azure Storage account resource

1.  Create a new Azure Storage account with the following details:
    
    -   Storage account name: **polystor*[yourname]***

    -   Existing resource group: **PolyglotData**

    -   Account kind: **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**

    -   Location: **(US) East US**

    -   Replication: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

    -   Performance: **Standard**

    -   Access tier (default): **Hot**

    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the storage account before you move forward with the lab. You'll receive a notification when the storage account is created.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created all the Azure resources that you'll need for a polyglot data solution.
