#### Task 1: Upload image blobs

1.  Go to the blade for the **polystor*[yourname]*** Azure Storage account that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  Open the Containers pane, and then create a new container with the following settings:

    -   Name: **images**

    -   Public access level: **Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)**

1.  Go to the new **images** container, and then open the Properties pane.

1.  In the Properties pane, record the value in the **URL** text box.

    > **Note**: You'll use this value later in this lab.

1.  Return to the blade for the **images** container.

1.  Use the **Upload** button to upload the 42 individual **.jpg** image files in the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\04\\Starter\\Images** folder on your lab machine.

    > **Note**: We recommended that you enable the **Overwrite if files already exist** option.
