#### Task 1: Deploy an application to the web app

1.  Open Visual Studio Code.

1.  In Visual Studio Code, open the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\12\\Starter\\Api** folder.

1.  Use the Explorer in Visual Studio Code to open a new terminal with the context set to the current working directory.

1.  Sign in to the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) by using your Azure credentials:

    ```
    az login
    ```

1.  List all the apps in your **MonitoredAssets** resource group:
    
    ```
    az webapp list --resource-group MonitoredAssets
    ```

1.  Find the apps that have the prefix **smpapi\***:
    
    ```
    az webapp list --resource-group MonitoredAssets --query "[?starts_with(name, 'smpapi')]"
    ```

1.  Print only the name of the single app that has the prefix **smpapi\***:

    ```
    az webapp list --resource-group MonitoredAssets --query "[?starts_with(name, 'smpapi')].{Name:name}" --output tsv
    ```

1.  Change the current directory to the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\12\\Starter** directory that contains the lab files:

    ```
    cd F:\Allfiles\Labs\12\Starter\
    ```

1.  Deploy the **api.zip** file to the web app that you created earlier in this lab:

    ```
    az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group MonitoredAssets --src api.zip --name <name-of-your-api-app>
    ```

    > **Note**: Replace the *name-of-your-api-app* placeholder with the name of the web app that you created earlier in this lab. You recently queried this appâ€™s name in the previous steps.

1.  Return to your currently open browser window that's displaying the Azure portal.

1.  Access the ***smpapi\***[yourname]*** web app that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  Open the ***smpapi\***[yourname]*** web app in your browser.

1.  Perform a GET request to the **/weatherforecast** relative path of the website, and then find the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) array that's returned as a result of using the API.

    > **Note**: For example, if your URL is https://smpapistudent.azurewebsites.net, the new URL would be https://smpapistudent.azurewebsites.net/weatherforecast.
