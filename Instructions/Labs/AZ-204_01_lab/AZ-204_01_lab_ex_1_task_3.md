### Task 3: Upload a sample blob

1.  Access the **imgstor*[yourname]*** storage account that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  In the **Blob service** section, select the **Containers** link.

1.  Create a new **container** with the following settings:
    
    -   Name: **images**

    -   Public access level: **Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)**

1.  Go to the new **images** container, and then use the **Upload** button to upload the **grilledcheese.jpg** file in the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\01\\Starter\\Images** folder on your lab machine.
