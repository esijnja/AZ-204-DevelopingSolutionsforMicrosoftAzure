    -   Name: **StorageConnectionString**

    -   Value: ***Storage Connection String copied earlier in this lab***

    -   Deployment slot setting: **Not selected**

1.  Save your changes to the application settings.

1.  In the **Settings** section, find the **Properties** section.

1.  In the **Properties** section, copy the value of the **URL** text box. You'll use this value later in the lab.

    > **Note**: At this point, the web server at this URL will return a 404 error. You have not deployed any code to the Web App yet. You will deploy code to the Web App later in this lab.
