#### Task 2: Test multimedia content by using the CDN

1.  Construct a URL for the **campus.jpg** resource by combining the **Endpoint hostname** URL from the **cdnmedia*[yourname]*** endpoint that you copied earlier in the lab with a relative path of **/campus.jpg**.

    > **Note**: For example, if your **Endpoint hostname** URL is **https://cdnmediastudent.azureedge.net/**, your newly constructed URL would be **https://cdnmediastudent.azureedge.net/campus.jpg**.

1.  Construct a URL for the **conference.jpg** resource by combining the **Endpoint hostname** URL from the **cdnmedia*[yourname]*** endpoint that you copied earlier in the lab with a relative path of **/conference.jpg**.

    > **Note**: For example, if your **Endpoint hostname** URL is **https://cdnmediastudent.azureedge.net/**, your newly constructed URL would be **https://cdnmediastudent.azureedge.net/conference.jpg**.

1.  Construct a URL for the **poster.jpg** resource by combining the **Endpoint hostname** URL from the **cdnmedia*[yourname]*** endpoint that you copied earlier in the lab with a relative path of **/poster.jpg**.

    > **Note**: For example, if your **Endpoint hostname** URL is **https://cdnmediastudent.azureedge.net/**, your newly constructed URL would be **https://cdnmediastudent.azureedge.net/poster.jpg**.

1.  Construct a URL for the **welcome.mp4** resource by combining the **Endpoint hostname** URL from the **cdnvideo*[yourname]*** endpoint that you copied earlier in the lab with a relative path of **/welcome.mp4**.

    > **Note**: For example, if your **Endpoint hostname** URL is **https://cdnvideostudent.azureedge.net/**, your newly constructed URL would be **https://cdnvideostudent.azureedge.net/welcome.mp4**.

1.  Open a new **Microsoft Edge** browser window.

1.  In the new browser window, go to the URL that you constructed for the **campus.jpg** media resource, and then verify that the resource was successfully found.

    > **Note**: If the content isn't available yet, the CDN endpoint is still initializing. This initialization process can take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes.

1.  Go to the URL that you constructed for the **conference.jpg** media resource, and then verify that the resource was successfully found.

1.  Go to the URL that you constructed for the **poster.jpg** media resource, and then verify that the resource was successfully found.

1.  Go to the URL that you constructed for the **welcome.mp4** video resource, and then verify that the resource was successfully found.

1.  Close the browser window that you created in this task.
