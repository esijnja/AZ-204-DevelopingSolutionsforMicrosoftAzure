#### Task 4: Validate that the container instance ran successfully

1.  Access the **manualcompute** container instance that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  Select the **Containers** link to get a list of the current containers that are running.

1.  Find the contents of the **Events** list for the container instance that ran your **ipcheck** application.

1.  Select the **Logs** tab, and then find the text logs from the container instance.

    > **Note**: You can also optionally find the **Events** and **Logs** from the **managedcompute** container instance.

#### Review

In this exercise, you used multiple methods to deploy a container image to an Azure container instance. By using the manual method, you were also able to customize the deployment further and run task-based applications as part of a container run.
