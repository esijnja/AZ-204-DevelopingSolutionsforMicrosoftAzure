#### Task 6: Validate your container image in Container Registry

1.  Access the container registry that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  Select the **Repositories** link to find your images in the registry.

1.  Proceed through the **Images** and **Tags** blades to find the metadata associated with the **ipcheck** image with the **latest** tag.

    > **Note**: You can also select the **Run ID** link to find the build task metadata.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created a .NET console application to display a machineâ€™s current IP address. You then added the **Dockerfile** file to the application so that it could be converted into a Docker container image. Finally, you deployed the container image to Container Registry.
