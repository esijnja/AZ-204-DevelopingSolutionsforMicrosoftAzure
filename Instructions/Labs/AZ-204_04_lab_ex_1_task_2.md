#### Task 2: Create an Azure SQL Database server resource

1.  Create a new **Azure SQL Database server (logical server)** resource with the following details:
    
    -   Server name: **polysqlsrvr*[yourname]***
        
    -   New resource group: **PolyglotData**

    -   Server admin login: **testuser**

    -   Password: **TestPa55w.rd**

    -   Location: **(US) East US**

    -   Allow Azure services to access server: **Yes**

    > **Note**: At this point in the lab, we are only creating the Azure SQL logical server. We will create the Azure SQL database instance later in the lab.

    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the SQL server instance before you move forward with the lab. You'll receive a notification when the SQL server is created.
