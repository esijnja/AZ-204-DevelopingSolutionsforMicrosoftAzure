#### Task 2: Upload a storage account blob

1.  Access the **mediastor*[yourname]*** storage account that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  Select the **Containers** link in the **Blob service** section, and then select the recently created **raster-graphics** container.
    
1.  In the **raster-graphics** container, select **Upload** to upload the **graph.jpg** file in the **Allfiles (F): \\Allfiles\\Labs\\03\\Starter\\Images** folder on your lab VM.

    > **Note**: We recommend that you enable the **Overwrite if files already exist** option. 

#### Review

In this exercise, you created a couple of placeholder containers in the storage account and populated one of the containers with a blob.
