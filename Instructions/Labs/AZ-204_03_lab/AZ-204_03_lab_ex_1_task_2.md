#### Task 2: Create a Storage account

1.  Create a new storage account with the following details:
    
    -    New resource group: **StorageMedia**

    -    Name: **mediastor*[yourname]***

    -    Location: **East US**

    -    Performance: **Standard**

    -    Account kind: **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**

    -    Replication: **Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)**

    -    Access tier: **Hot**

    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the storage account before you move forward with the lab. You'll receive a notification when the account is created.

1.  Open the **Properties** section of your newly created storage account instance.

1.  Record the value in the **Primary Blob Service Endpoint** text box. You'll use this value later in this lab.

1.  Open the **Access Keys** section of the storage account instance.

1.  Record the value in the **Storage account name** text box and any of the **Key** text boxes. You'll use these values later in this lab.
