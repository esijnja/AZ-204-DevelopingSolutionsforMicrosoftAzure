#### Task 3: Test the httpbin web application

1.	Access the **httpapi*[yourname]*** web app that you created earlier in this lab. 

1.  Open the **httpapi*[yourname]*** web app in your browser.

1.  Test the API by selecting the **Response formats** option, selecting **GET /xml**, selecting **Try it out**, and then finally by selecting **Execute**.

1.  Observe the response from the HTTP request. Specifically, observe the content of the **Request URL**, **Response body**, and **Response headers** text boxes.

1.  Return to the Azure portal and the **Web App** blade for the **httpapi*[yourname]*** web app. 

1.  Access the **Properties** section of the **Web App** blade.

1.  In the **Properties** section, record the value of the **URL** text box. You'll use this value later in the lab to make requests against the API.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created a new Azure web app by using a container image sourced from Docker Hub.
