#### Task 4: Test the updated application

1.  Using a terminal, run the .NET console application project:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > **Note**: If there are any build errors, review the **Program.cs** file in the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\Solution\\GraphClient** folder.

1.  The running console application will automatically open an instance of the default browser.

1.  In the open browser window, sign in by using your Microsoft account.

    > **Note**: You might have the option to select an existing Microsoft account as opposed to signing in again.

1.  The browser window will automatically go to the **Permissions requested** webpage. Accept the request for permissions.

1.  Close the currently open browser window.

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, observe the token render in the output from the currently running console application.

1.  Close the current terminal.
